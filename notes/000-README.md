**_Fleeting Note_** 🟩 - Used for capturing ideas quickly. They serve as mere reminders of information and can be written in a variety of ways. Taking them should not distract you from your work.

**_Permanent Note_** 🟥 - Used to capture ideas from text (literature note) or used to elaborate on and create an atomic note (permanent slip-box note). Permanent means they are kept forever.

**_Project Note**_ 🟨 - Used to capture information pertaining to a particular project. Kept together in a project-specific folder and are archived or discarded when the project is finished.



go through your fleeting and literature notes and translate them into permanent notes, using the following process:

1.  Identify what’s relevant to your own research, interest, or thinking
2.  Elaborate on the idea until it’s understood without its prior context
3.  Connect (link) it to existing permanent notes in the slip-box

## Key topics

---


1.  Identify a sequence or cluster of notes that support a common idea or argument.
2.  Ask, “What topic would be best positioned in the middle?”.
3.  If the index was a section in a bookstore, the topic would be the title, section, or chapter of a book within that section.
4.  Once you have an answer, you have the name of your topic note.
5.  Click, New note.
6.  Give the new topic note a name that helps bridge the index to the slip-box notes.
