# Reflection: on Finding my ikigai. Live first work second
#self-insight #understandMyself #life


Things that give meeting:
- A community
- Seeing others grow and helping others be better
- Building a digital product that helps with sustainability, equity, intersectinality, fairness

I like doing / Strenghts
- Programming
- Analitical thinking
- Planning and organizing
- Vision, big picture
- Values first - reading science - empathy


Maybe for my career I could:
- Work for a product with interesting tech stack, where I have fun, but keep being an individual contributor, and quit the idea of performing/achieving/fighting/changing culture/achieving collective goals etc... But rather be an IC, focus on the craft, have fun
- In my personal life: invest, connect, create digital things, or communities that give me that meaning
- Quick thoughts: 
	- have 1 mentee at a time always at least? example: Keep Kim?  -- 
	- keep evolving my relationship with my mentor
	- write about my struggle with my career:
		- my belief of achieving, managing, etc, showing, distracted me of the craft.
		- the amount of energy I have got to put to deal with patriarchal structures at work, has taken energy from me to invest on my own career and growth and my craft
		- what is that what I am very good at at the moment? what are my actual skills? If I am bad at tech at the moment, what am I good at?
- Wouldnt it be cool to have some sort of collective to have in a physical space:
	- Teather, improv, performances, etc.
	- Things for children
	- Co-working spaces
	- Queer meetups
	- Workshops, code camps for new comers in tech

#### Life
- Be again active:
	- get in mach3
	- get in theater and improv theater
	- go to drawing course
	- go to a cafe or something to work on my pet-project idea
	- find and attend a collective (with intersection of tech and art maybe? or is it too hippie?)
