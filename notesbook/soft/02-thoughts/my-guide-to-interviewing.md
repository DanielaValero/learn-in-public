*** Right mindset for interview**
  * One intervew a day is best
  * If I am too stressed, is better to reschedule
  * Warm up before coding interviews
* **Diagnosing culture match by talks to interviwers:** How experienced are the iterviwers, and how comfortable I feel talking with them:

  * Have support
  * Understand and be unterstood
  * Be able to be myself, this means: I am a woman who leads, codes and behaves in a collaborative manner, looking to improve the tech and the proccesses of building softare - In contrast of: focus on business needs alone, deadlines, compromising human wellbeing for 'progress', defensiveness, competitiveness
